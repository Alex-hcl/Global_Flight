# Global Flight Network and Airport Infrastructure Analysis

## Overview

This project explores the spatial distribution of global flight networks and airport infrastructure using data visualization. By analyzing global flight connectivity, airport density, ticket pricing, and flight schedules, the project provides insights into the dynamics of air transportation and its relationship with economic development.

## Features

- **Global Flight Network Visualization**: Visualizes airport connectivity across regions using network graphs.
- **Airport Density Heatmap**: Displays the spatial distribution of airports globally.
- **Scatterplot Analysis**: Examines the relationship between land area and airport counts for developed and developing countries.
- **Bar Chart**: Highlights the top 10 countries by airport count.
- **Flight Trends**: Analyzes daily and weekly flight patterns using heatmaps and bubble charts.
- **Ticket Pricing Visualization**: Illustrates ticket price ranges and averages for flights from Los Angeles.

## Dataset Sources

1. **OpenFlights Database**: Global airport locations and flight routes.
2. **ITA Matrix**: Ticket pricing data (powered by Google).
3. **FlightAware API**: Flight schedules and operational data.
4. **Publicly Available Airline Timetables**: Additional flight schedule information.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python Libraries**:
  - `Matplotlib`: For generating heatmaps, bar charts, and scatterplots.
  - `Seaborn`: For enhanced data visualization aesthetics.
  - `NetworkX`: For constructing and visualizing network graphs.

- **JavaScript**: Used for interactive elements and enhancing user experience.
